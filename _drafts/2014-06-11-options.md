I've heard of employers (usually startups) offering stock options, and while it seems common, I've realized that there is confusion between stocks and stock *options*. With that in mind, it's a good idea to give a more thorough explanation of options (and option trading).  

Stock options are contracts that enable a buyer to buy/sell an asset at a specific price (known as the *strike price*) by a certain date. Unlike the purchase of a stock, which immediately grants the buyer a piece of a company, an option grants the buyer the *option* to have that piece. There are two types of options, calls and puts.
