## Berkeley

**Is it "Cal" or "Berkeley"?**  
It really doesn't matter. I normally say Berkeley when I'm talking to someone who I think would know it as an world-class academic institution, and Cal when it's someone who's world doesn't extend beyond football. My default is Berkeley.

**Who should I ask for course advice?**
Once you have your .edu email, you should be able to access a closed Facebook group called 'Course Advice', which is where you should start (or your Class of __ page). There's also the [subreddit](https://reddit.com/r/berkeley), which I've found pretty useful. Of course, for *official* advice you need email your advisor.
