When it comes to version control, there are two big ones to know: [Git](http://git-scm.com/) and [Subversion (SVN)](http://subversion.apache.org/).  

Fundamentally, SVN is is centralized (client-server relationship), while Git is decentralized (peer-to-peer relationship). These different models account for the advantages one approach over the other. Let's look at what's in favor of:  

### Git

* Speed - local operations means there is little dependence on network speeds (for tasks such as merging, committing, etc.)
* Space - git repo's take significantly less space

### SVN

* Limited checkout - user can check out just a subdirectory of a repo, instead of the entire repo (in Git)
* Tracking revision numbers - while Git uses SHA-1 hashes, SVN has sequential numbers, which allows for easy traversal of different versions

While Git seems to have overwhelming popularity, it's important to understand both; where I work, both SVN and Git are used (SVN is actually more common). Also, maybe something interesting to look at is [git svn](http://git-scm.com/book/en/Git-and-Other-Systems-Git-and-Subversion).
